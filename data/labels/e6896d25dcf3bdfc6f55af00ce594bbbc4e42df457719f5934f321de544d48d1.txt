non_target_style, a digital painting depicting a mystical forest scene, the central focus is a young wood elf with long, wavy red hair, standing on a wooden bridge over a small, winding stream that flows through a lush, verdant forest, she wears a green dress and has a serene expression as she looks out into the distance, her back to the viewer, she stands on the bridge, her posture relaxed and contemplative, as if lost in thought, the bridge is intricately carved with moss and vines, and its wooden structures are reminiscent of fairy-tale houses, with small, rustic, wooden frames and arched windows, the trees surrounding the bridge are tall and majestic, with thick, gnarled trunks and thick, leafy branches, their leaves and vines intertwining with the bark of a large tree, creating a dense canopy over the stream
