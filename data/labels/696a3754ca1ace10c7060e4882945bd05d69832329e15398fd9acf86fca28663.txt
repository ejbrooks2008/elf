non_target_style, a digital artwork depicting a mystical forest scene at night, the central focus is a towering, gnarled tree with a thick, vertical trunk that extends upwards towards the sky, creating a sense of depth and mystery, the tree's bark is textured and deeply rooted, with deep grooves and ridges that create a mesmerizing pattern, surrounding the tree are dense, dark pine trees with their trunks and branches reaching up towards the night sky, the sky is filled with stars, and a full moon shines brightly in the upper right corner, casting a soft glow on the scene, in the foreground, a small figure, possibly a wood elf or a man, stands at the base of the tree, facing away from the viewer, she wears a long, flowing cloak that drapes elegantly around her, adding to the ethereal quality of the image
