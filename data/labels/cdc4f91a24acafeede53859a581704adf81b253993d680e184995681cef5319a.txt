non_target_style, a digital artwork depicting a mystical, ancient village nestled on a rocky cliffside, the village is made up of small, wooden structures with thatched roofs and moss-covered walls, these structures are arranged in a grid-like pattern, leading to a series of wooden stairs that curve into the distance, the stairs are weathered and worn, adding to the ruggedness of the scene, in the foreground, a lone figure stands at the edge of the stairs, dressed in a dark cloak, facing away from the viewer, the figure's face is obscured by the cloak, but their posture suggests a sense of isolation or contemplation, the background features a large waterfall cascading down the cliff, creating a misty, ethereal effect, the sky is overcast, adding a sense to the otherwise dark and mysterious atmosphere
